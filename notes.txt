## Intro to DB, Section 8
SQL:

SELECT FROM WHERE 

when using WHERE, ORDER BY any columns in use has to have INDEXes(for speed)
inserting and updating table with indexes takes more time, because indexes has to be updated

ORDER BY column1 DESC;

INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2)
VALUES (value2, value3),
       (value5, value6);

escape:

$sql = "INSERT INTO article (title, content, published_at)
            VALUES ('" . mysqli_escape_string($conn, $_POST['title']) ."','"
                        . mysqli_escape_string($conn, $_POST['content']) ."','"
                        . mysqli_escape_string($conn, $_POST['published_at']) ."')";


UPDATE table_name
SET colum1 = value1,
    column2 = value2
WHERE condition;

(WHERE is important, because without it, it will update all rows with col)

UPDATE article
SET title = 'Updated title'
WHERE id = 6

DELETE FROM table_name
WHERE condition;

DELETE FROM article
WHERE id = 8

(any clause with where statement, need index)
(if no WHERE, every row will be deleted)
