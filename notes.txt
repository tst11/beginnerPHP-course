## Intro to DB, Section 8
SQL:

SELECT FROM WHERE 

when using WHERE, ORDER BY any columns in use has to have INDEXes(for speed)
inserting and updating table with indexes takes more time, because indexes has to be updated

ORDER BY column1 DESC;

INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2)
VALUES (value2, value3),
       (value5, value6);
